                </h2>

                
                

                <p>When you use a computer regularly, over time, you will accumulate lots of files and documents which are meaningful to you. It could be personal documents, digital products that you have downloaded and saved, research material, articles, and so on. But is all this data safe and secure? It would probably be very unpleasant if one day you lost all these files or if someone got access to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><img alt="Cloud" src="https://botondus.com/images/alex-machado-80sv993lUKI-unsplash.jpg" title="Cloud in the sky"></p>
<p><em>Photo by</em> <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alexmachado?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"><em>Alex Machado</em></a> <em>on</em> <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cloud?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p>
<p>These are the elements of data security that are important to&nbsp;consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>data redundancy: in the case of a computer failure you should still have access to an <strong>up to date</strong> backup of your&nbsp;files</li>
<li>data privacy: other people cannot access your files unless you explicitly share&nbsp;them</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else to consider is that you are likely using multiple devices: a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet, a smartphone, and so on. Ideally, you would want easy access to your files on all your devices whenever you need it. That is what cloud-based automatic file syncing services allow you to&nbsp;do.</p>
<h1>Data&nbsp;Redundancy</h1>
<p>Any computing device that you currently own will fail sooner or later. You could accidentally drop your laptop onto the ground, and it will break. Or it could fail over time due to normal wear and tear through no fault of your own. So you cannot rely on the storage of any physical device you own, no matter how high quality it is. If you do, you will eventually lose your&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>One option to resolve this issue is to manually take backups onto an external hard drive, optical disks, or other physical storage media. But this is a manual step, so it is not practical to do it frequently. And that external physical media is also subject to breaking&nbsp;eventually.</p>
<p>All <strong>cloud storage</strong> services aim to solve this problem. Once you set one up, it will automatically upload your files from a designated folder to the cloud. And if you connect a second or third device to it, they will download these files as well. So another benefit is that you can interchangeably access and work on them, without constant manual&nbsp;copying.</p>
<p>Problem solved,&nbsp;right?</p>
<h1>Data&nbsp;Privacy</h1>
<p>The catch is that this potentially exposes your data to the company that stores it, the government (with the revelation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)"><span class="caps">PRISM</span></a> surveillance program this is a real possibility). Or you could be collateral damage to any hackers who target that company. Most <strong>cloud storage</strong> solutions do not protect you from&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>The solution to this is called <strong>zero-knowledge encryption</strong>. In this case, the data gets <strong>encrypted</strong> on your computer before it gets uploaded to the cloud. The uploaded files do not make any sense whatsoever without the key (the password), which you have used to encrypt them. It is just a meaningless pile of data without it. The cloud storage service does not have access to this&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>There are not that many services that offer such a proper level of privacy. The most popular ones are <a href="https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=964cb40">Sync.com</a>, <a href="https://www.pcloud.com/eu">pCloud</a>, and <a href="https://mega.nz/startpage"><span class="caps">MEGA</span></a>. I use <a href="https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=964cb40">Sync.com</a>, so that is what I can most recommend, but feel free to check out the other options as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h1>Setting&nbsp;Up</h1>
<p>Once you have chosen a provider, you will need&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>register account with a strong&nbsp;password</li>
<li>install the application on the computer where most of your data&nbsp;lives</li>
<li>choose the folder (or folders) which you want to back&nbsp;up</li>
<li>wait for the initial sync to&nbsp;happen</li>
<li>install on additional devices as&nbsp;needed</li>
</ul>
<p>One caveat with <strong>zero-knowledge encryption</strong> is that you will need to remember your password, or you may not be able to download your data anymore. I highly recommend that you add it to a <a href="https://botondus.com/online-security-101-online-accounts.html">password manager</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have your application going on your computer, it might take a long time for it to upload all your files to the cloud. It depends on how much you are backing up and the upload speed of your internet connection. Also, it will take time to fully download on a second device, if you need to do that. But it’s done automatically, and it will be kept up to date with new files automatically and&nbsp;painlessly.</p>
<p>On smartphones, it won’t sync all your data, it will just get the specific file that you wish to open&nbsp;on-demand.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope that I have persuaded you to set up an automated <strong>cloud storage</strong> backup for your files. And especially to use a private service if at all possible, but any solution is better than nothing. For specific instructions, you can look at the website of your chosen solution, I’ve only covered a general overview&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Now go on and back up your&nbsp;data!</p>

                    <a href="https://botondus.com/online-security-101-privacy-vpn.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Online Security 101: How to protect your privacy with a VPN&quot;">Online Security 101: How to protect your privacy with a <span class="caps">VPN</span></a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>One important thing about the internet is that you may be effectively broadcasting your location to any website you visit. That is if you browse it without any protection and if they care to check. And a lot of them do!
When you connect to the internet from a computer, it communicates something called a public <span class="caps">IP</span> address. Necessary for traffic between your computer and the computer which hosts the website you visit. The problem is that the real public <span class="caps">IP</span> address you have can give away your location quite&nbsp;precisely.</p>
<p>To test how precisely, please go to the following website, click on Show Location and then come back here: <a href="https://dnschecker.org/ip-location.php">DNSChecker</a>

<em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtopkin1?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Dayne Topkin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/privacy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p>
<p>You have seen multiple locations there, determined based on various <span class="caps">IP</span> to Location databases. Some may be more accurate than others. While it is only an estimation of your address, quite often it can be scarily&nbsp;accurate.</p>
<h2>What is the solution for&nbsp;this?</h2>
<p>There are a few different solutions, but the best one is to use a <span class="caps">VPN</span>  (Virtual Private Network) service. Your computer connects to a server from the <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider. Then you connect to anything on the internet through that providers’ server. In terms of <span class="caps">IP</span> address, then everyone on the other end will see that <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider’s <span class="caps">IP</span> address, which doesn’t give any truly identifying location&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Of course, the <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider that you use needs to be trustworthy, and it needs to perform well. You can search online for ratings and reviews of the best options. I am a satisfied customer of <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com">Private Internet Access</a>, but when my subscription renewal comes up, I also plan to give a proper evaluation to <a href="https://protonvpn.com">ProtonVPN</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider, make sure that you install their application on all your devices (computers, tablets, smartphones). Also, configure it in such a way that it will automatically connect and protect you. It should be simple to do or even the default option for most good&nbsp;providers.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a <span class="caps">VPN</span></h2>
<p>Hiding your real <span class="caps">IP</span> address (and location) is not the only benefit of using a <span class="caps">VPN</span>. There are several other significant&nbsp;benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>encrypts your internet traffic end to end between your computer and any websites that you&nbsp;access</li>
<li>makes it way more difficult for others to track your browsing&nbsp;activity</li>
<li>you can access many websites which block users in your&nbsp;country</li>
</ul>
<h3>Provides end to end&nbsp;encryption</h3>
<p>With such encryption, if anyone intercepts your internet traffic, they won’t be able to make any sense of it. For example, when you log in to your online banking, if someone gets access to your internet connection, they could intercept your username and password after you submit it before it even gets to that&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>You are especially exposed to this if you are on public Wi-Fi or some other shared internet connection. It’s pretty hard to do for your home connection. Through a <span class="caps">VPN</span> though you are pretty&nbsp;safe.</p>
<h3>Obscures tracking of your browsing&nbsp;activity</h3>
<p>When you browse through a <span class="caps">VPN</span>, this doesn’t directly block the tracking activity that is done by Facebook, Google, or many others. But when they collect the tracking information, it is associated with the <span class="caps">IP</span> of the <span class="caps">VPN</span> server, which may be used by thousands of customers, so it’s harder to link it directly to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>To block such tracking activity completely, we need to look at other tools as well, which is a topic for another blog&nbsp;post.</p>
<h3>Access websites blocked in your&nbsp;country</h3>
<p>Another great benefit is that if there is some web content that blocks users from your country, there is a good chance that you will be able to circumvent this blocking through your <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider. When you connect with the <span class="caps">VPN</span>, you can choose a different country, and then any website will view you as coming from that&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>Not a 100% foolproof solution, because certain websites (like Netflix) will actively try to detect and block any <span class="caps">VPN</span> traffic, precisely to not allow such circumvention. But it should work fine for you in many&nbsp;cases.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope that by now, I have convinced you that using a <span class="caps">VPN</span> service is essential for your privacy and protection on the internet. A lot of the available services have free tiers or trials, and the paid versions as well are very reasonably priced for the value that you are getting.
I wish you all the best and safe&nbsp;browsing!</p>
