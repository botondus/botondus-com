When you connect to the internet from a computer, it communicates something called a public <span class="caps">IP</span> address. Necessary for traffic between your computer and the computer which hosts the website you visit. The problem is that the real public <span class="caps">IP</span> address you have can give away your location quite&nbsp;precisely.</p>
<p>To test how precisely, please go to the following website, click on Show Location and then come back here: <a href="https://dnschecker.org/ip-location.php">DNSChecker</a>

<em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtopkin1?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Dayne Topkin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/privacy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p>
<p>You have seen multiple locations there, determined based on various <span class="caps">IP</span> to Location databases. Some may be more accurate than others. While it is only an estimation of your address, quite often it can be scarily&nbsp;accurate.</p>
<h2>What is the solution for&nbsp;this?</h2>
<p>There are a few different solutions, but the best one is to use a <span class="caps">VPN</span>  (Virtual Private Network) service. Your computer connects to a server from the <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider. Then you connect to anything on the internet through that providers’ server. In terms of <span class="caps">IP</span> address, then everyone on the other end will see that <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider’s <span class="caps">IP</span> address, which doesn’t give any truly identifying location&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Of course, the <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider that you use needs to be trustworthy, and it needs to perform well. You can search online for ratings and reviews of the best options. I am a satisfied customer of <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com">Private Internet Access</a>, but when my subscription renewal comes up, I also plan to give a proper evaluation to <a href="https://protonvpn.com">ProtonVPN</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider, make sure that you install their application on all your devices (computers, tablets, smartphones). Also, configure it in such a way that it will automatically connect and protect you. It should be simple to do or even the default option for most good&nbsp;providers.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a <span class="caps">VPN</span></h2>
<p>Hiding your real <span class="caps">IP</span> address (and location) is not the only benefit of using a <span class="caps">VPN</span>. There are several other significant&nbsp;benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>encrypts your internet traffic end to end between your computer and any websites that you&nbsp;access</li>
<li>makes it way more difficult for others to track your browsing&nbsp;activity</li>
<li>you can access many websites which block users in your&nbsp;country</li>
</ul>
<h3>Provides end to end&nbsp;encryption</h3>
<p>With such encryption, if anyone intercepts your internet traffic, they won’t be able to make any sense of it. For example, when you log in to your online banking, if someone gets access to your internet connection, they could intercept your username and password after you submit it before it even gets to that&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>You are especially exposed to this if you are on public Wi-Fi or some other shared internet connection. It’s pretty hard to do for your home connection. Through a <span class="caps">VPN</span> though you are pretty&nbsp;safe.</p>
<h3>Obscures tracking of your browsing&nbsp;activity</h3>
<p>When you browse through a <span class="caps">VPN</span>, this doesn’t directly block the tracking activity that is done by Facebook, Google, or many others. But when they collect the tracking information, it is associated with the <span class="caps">IP</span> of the <span class="caps">VPN</span> server, which may be used by thousands of customers, so it’s harder to link it directly to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>To block such tracking activity completely, we need to look at other tools as well, which is a topic for another blog&nbsp;post.</p>
<h3>Access websites blocked in your&nbsp;country</h3>
<p>Another great benefit is that if there is some web content that blocks users from your country, there is a good chance that you will be able to circumvent this blocking through your <span class="caps">VPN</span> provider. When you connect with the <span class="caps">VPN</span>, you can choose a different country, and then any website will view you as coming from that&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>Not a 100% foolproof solution, because certain websites (like Netflix) will actively try to detect and block any <span class="caps">VPN</span> traffic, precisely to not allow such circumvention. But it should work fine for you in many&nbsp;cases.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope that by now, I have convinced you that using a <span class="caps">VPN</span> service is essential for your privacy and protection on the internet. A lot of the available services have free tiers or trials, and the paid versions as well are very reasonably priced for the value that you are getting.
I wish you all the best and safe&nbsp;browsing!</p></div>
