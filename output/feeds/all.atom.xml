Used like that, they are detrimental to your software business and your employees. Before you jump at my throat, I am not against having a project schedule, milestones, or project management in general. It’s a matter of mindset, language, and making conscious trade-offs. I’m also not against deadlines entirely. I merely think that they are overused, with little conscious thought and justification, and with no regard to the&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Language&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you call a date a deadline, then that implies that you have set it in stone, it is inflexible. You are making the constraint of time the foremost priority implicitly. If there is no clear, highly defined, and communicated motivation behind it, then it is likely to breed resentment and discontent in many of your employees. And by that, I don’t mean some meaningless management jargon like: to meet our business objectives. That may be so, but it needs to be more specific than&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which objective does it aim to impact, and in what&amp;nbsp;measure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of trade-offs are you willing to take to meet that&amp;nbsp;objective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the cost of&amp;nbsp;delay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deadline example would be: a country in which we operate is introducing new laws and regulations, and we have until date X to comply with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the time constraint already. The main ones that you can control in a project are time, cost, scope, and quality. If you have a deadline and it’s not something that you know well ahead of time, then your time is fixed, and you will need to sacrifice either cost, scope, or quality. But if you always consider time like that, then it is likely that you are fixated on every other constraint as well. What happens often is that quality is sacrificed implicitly first, with disastrous medium to long term results. Quality is not even acknowledged explicitly as a constraint by many project&amp;nbsp;managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that you sacrifice quality last. Make sure that the project has adequate staff. You can add more people to the project by increasing budget/costs, and this will gain you time. But this needs to be done as early as possible because trying to do this very late will backfire as you can read in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;. Reduce scope as much as possible, and if that reached its limits, then you will be forced to sacrifice on quality if time is indeed the foremost&amp;nbsp;priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The two kinds of&amp;nbsp;quality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at quality, there are two kinds that we need to think&amp;nbsp;about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;external&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most non-technical people will understand &lt;strong&gt;external quality&lt;/strong&gt; easily because this is what you can see as an&amp;nbsp;end-user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the application look&amp;nbsp;good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it do the required&amp;nbsp;functions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it run without&amp;nbsp;errors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can it handle the load from all the users we&amp;nbsp;have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management will understand the danger of sacrificing this kind of quality because it tends to result in immediate negative feedback from the end-users. Yet, even some of this gets sacrificed more often than we’d like to admit if we fixate on the time&amp;nbsp;constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal quality,&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand, is more difficult to understand and see, often even for software engineers, especially the inexperienced ones. It represents how easy and safe it is to make future modifications to the&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the code “clean” and nicely&amp;nbsp;structured?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it have a comprehensive suite of automated&amp;nbsp;tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the application’s architecture well&amp;nbsp;designed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking at this from a very high-level view here because there are entire books written on each of these questions. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GSTOAM/"&gt;Clean Code&lt;/a&gt; is one that is usually close at hand for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrificing &lt;strong&gt;internal quality&lt;/strong&gt; when time could be flexible is a poor financial decision. Financial? Yes, because you are accruing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt"&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt;, which is quite similar to financial debt just less visible. If you don&amp;#8217;t repay it in short order (by improving the internal quality), then the software will be increasingly more difficult (read: expensive) to modify as time goes on. You will be paying the interest for the technical debt every time you need to add a new feature or fix a bug, and this will slow you down considerably. That means that you need to choose the times when you sacrifice internal quality over time very carefully and deliberately. It also needs to be accompanied by a plan to pay back the technical debt that you&amp;#8217;ve incurred in the short&amp;nbsp;term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Software development is a marathon, not a&amp;nbsp;sprint&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about real and reasonably complicated business software here. It will not get done in one month or three months. Even if you launch the first &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt; to production in 3 months, that is just the beginning. It begins a journey, spanning potentially multiple years in which you continually improve the quality and add new features based on user&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, you need to set a pace that is sustainable in the medium to long term. You cannot just sprint and sprint and sprint again, pushing continuous overtime to keep fixed deadlines. Sustained overtime only gives an illusion of increased productivity anyway, because the per hour quality and quantity of work will inevitably suffer, so you don’t gain much. It can even be entirely counter-productive because overly tired and unfocused engineers will tend to make mistakes that will cost you big time in the long&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you sacrifice quality early to meet fixed deadlines, then at first things will move fast, but in a few months, the technical debt will catch up with you, and you will gradually progress slower and slower. You can then throw more resources at the problem, but that will mean ballooning costs to keep up the same pace of development, and you’ll accumulate more technical debt without an explicit focus on internal quality. You need to repay technical debt early and often, and when at all possible, do not accrue significant new&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Having a&amp;nbsp;schedule&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set a schedule with dates that are not externally imposed, then talk about target dates or milestones. If these are aggressive but not too much so then you can inspire a sense of exciting challenge in your employees, so they will still be taken seriously, and they can rally to meet the challenge. But they know that it’s not a looming sword over their head, the schedule may be extended if there is proper justification for it. Though, you would still want to decrease scope aggressively before resorting to a delay in the target dates. More often than not, this can solve any schedule dependency&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have dealt with reducing scope, then instead of sacrificing quality it is better to extend the target date or milestone date until the desired level is satisfied. Investing in quality early actually increases your speed and agility in the medium to long term, so you have much less risk of missing future target dates and milestones, and yes, the eventual deadline. It is a win-win scenario. For this, we do require a specific definition of what that quality entails, but that&amp;#8217;s a whole other topic. We are not aiming for perfection here because that is entirely impractical, but there should be a well defined, high standard. For many projects, these standards are set far too&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software development is a complex business, and this topic, in particular, is a challenging one. There is a lot more to go into that won’t fit into a single article, but I hope that I have illustrated a few key&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overuse of deadlines makes you fixate on the time constraint, so you tend to sacrifice&amp;nbsp;quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing software is a medium to long term&amp;nbsp;investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sacrificing quality in the short term will cause you to lose time overall in the medium to long&amp;nbsp;run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It could be personal documents, digital products that you have downloaded and saved, research material, articles, and so on. But is all this data safe and secure? It would probably be very unpleasant if one day you lost all these files or if someone got access to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud" src="https://botondus.github.io/botondus.com/images/alex-machado-80sv993lUKI-unsplash.jpg" title="Cloud in the sky"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the elements of data security that are important to&amp;nbsp;consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data redundancy: in the case of a computer failure you should still have access to an &lt;strong&gt;up to date&lt;/strong&gt; backup of your&amp;nbsp;files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data privacy: other people cannot access your files unless you explicitly share&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else to consider is that you are likely using multiple devices: a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet, a smartphone, and so on. Ideally, you would want easy access to your files on all your devices whenever you need it. That is what cloud-based automatic file syncing services allow you to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data&amp;nbsp;Redundancy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any computing device that you currently own will fail sooner or later. You could accidentally drop your laptop onto the ground, and it will break. Or it could fail over time due to normal wear and tear through no fault of your own. So you cannot rely on the storage of any physical device you own, no matter how high quality it is. If you do, you will eventually lose your&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option to resolve this issue is to manually take backups onto an external hard drive, optical disks, or other physical storage media. But this is a manual step, so it is not practical to do it frequently. And that external physical media is also subject to breaking&amp;nbsp;eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;cloud storage&lt;/strong&gt; services aim to solve this problem. Once you set one up, it will automatically upload your files from a designated folder to the cloud. And if you connect a second or third device to it, they will download these files as well. So another benefit is that you can interchangeably access and work on them, without constant manual&amp;nbsp;copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem solved,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data&amp;nbsp;Privacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is that this potentially exposes your data to the company that stores it, the government (with the revelation of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRISM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; surveillance program this is a real possibility). Or you could be collateral damage to any hackers who target that company. Most &lt;strong&gt;cloud storage&lt;/strong&gt; solutions do not protect you from&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this is called &lt;strong&gt;zero-knowledge encryption&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, the data gets &lt;strong&gt;encrypted&lt;/strong&gt; on your computer before it gets uploaded to the cloud. The uploaded files do not make any sense whatsoever without the key (the password), which you have used to encrypt them. It is just a meaningless pile of data without it. The cloud storage service does not have access to this&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not that many services that offer such a proper level of privacy. The most popular ones are &lt;a href="https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=964cb40"&gt;Sync.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pcloud.com/eu"&gt;pCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mega.nz/startpage"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEGA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href="https://www.sync.com/?_sync_refer=964cb40"&gt;Sync.com&lt;/a&gt;, so that is what I can most recommend, but feel free to check out the other options as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setting&amp;nbsp;Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have chosen a provider, you will need&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;register account with a strong&amp;nbsp;password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the application on the computer where most of your data&amp;nbsp;lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose the folder (or folders) which you want to back&amp;nbsp;up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wait for the initial sync to&amp;nbsp;happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install on additional devices as&amp;nbsp;needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat with &lt;strong&gt;zero-knowledge encryption&lt;/strong&gt; is that you will need to remember your password, or you may not be able to download your data anymore. I highly recommend that you add it to a &lt;a href="https://botondus.github.io/botondus.com/online-security-101-online-accounts.html"&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your application going on your computer, it might take a long time for it to upload all your files to the cloud. It depends on how much you are backing up and the upload speed of your internet connection. Also, it will take time to fully download on a second device, if you need to do that. But it’s done automatically, and it will be kept up to date with new files automatically and&amp;nbsp;painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On smartphones, it won’t sync all your data, it will just get the specific file that you wish to open&amp;nbsp;on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I have persuaded you to set up an automated &lt;strong&gt;cloud storage&lt;/strong&gt; backup for your files. And especially to use a private service if at all possible, but any solution is better than nothing. For specific instructions, you can look at the website of your chosen solution, I’ve only covered a general overview&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

That is if you browse it without any protection and if they care to check. And a lot of them do!
When you connect to the internet from a computer, it communicates something called a public &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. Necessary for traffic between your computer and the computer which hosts the website you visit. The problem is that the real public &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address you have can give away your location quite&amp;nbsp;precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test how precisely, please go to the following website, click on Show Location and then come back here: &lt;a href="https://dnschecker.org/ip-location.php"&gt;DNSChecker&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtopkin1?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Dayne Topkin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/privacy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have seen multiple locations there, determined based on various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; to Location databases. Some may be more accurate than others. While it is only an estimation of your address, quite often it can be scarily&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the solution for&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few different solutions, but the best one is to use a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;  (Virtual Private Network) service. Your computer connects to a server from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; provider. Then you connect to anything on the internet through that providers’ server. In terms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address, then everyone on the other end will see that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; provider’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address, which doesn’t give any truly identifying location&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; provider that you use needs to be trustworthy, and it needs to perform well. You can search online for ratings and reviews of the best options. I am a satisfied customer of &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt;, but when my subscription renewal comes up, I also plan to give a proper evaluation to &lt;a href="https://protonvpn.com"&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have chosen a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; provider, make sure that you install their application on all your devices (computers, tablets, smartphones). Also, configure it in such a way that it will automatically connect and protect you. It should be simple to do or even the default option for most good&amp;nbsp;providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding your real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address (and location) is not the only benefit of using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;. There are several other significant&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encrypts your internet traffic end to end between your computer and any websites that you&amp;nbsp;access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes it way more difficult for others to track your browsing&amp;nbsp;activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can access many websites which block users in your&amp;nbsp;country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Provides end to end&amp;nbsp;encryption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such encryption, if anyone intercepts your internet traffic, they won’t be able to make any sense of it. For example, when you log in to your online banking, if someone gets access to your internet connection, they could intercept your username and password after you submit it before it even gets to that&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are especially exposed to this if you are on public Wi-Fi or some other shared internet connection. It’s pretty hard to do for your home connection. Through a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; though you are pretty&amp;nbsp;safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Obscures tracking of your browsing&amp;nbsp;activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you browse through a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;, this doesn’t directly block the tracking activity that is done by Facebook, Google, or many others. But when they collect the tracking information, it is associated with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; server, which may be used by thousands of customers, so it’s harder to link it directly to&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To block such tracking activity completely, we need to look at other tools as well, which is a topic for another blog&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access websites blocked in your&amp;nbsp;country&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great benefit is that if there is some web content that blocks users from your country, there is a good chance that you will be able to circumvent this blocking through your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; provider. When you connect with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;, you can choose a different country, and then any website will view you as coming from that&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a 100% foolproof solution, because certain websites (like Netflix) will actively try to detect and block any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; traffic, precisely to not allow such circumvention. But it should work fine for you in many&amp;nbsp;cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that by now, I have convinced you that using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; service is essential for your privacy and protection on the internet. A lot of the available services have free tiers or trials, and the paid versions as well are very reasonably priced for the value that you are getting.

You will need an email and a &lt;strong&gt;password&lt;/strong&gt; for each online&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often what you end up doing, however, is that you think of a few passwords (or even just one), and then you re-use them on many different sites. But this is a dangerous practice because when attackers breach the security of one particular website, and your password gets exposed, they will be able to use it to access many other online accounts where you kept using the same&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep these online accounts safe from malicious attackers, you need&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; password for each online&amp;nbsp;account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt; on accounts where it is&amp;nbsp;available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You need many different&amp;nbsp;passwords&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come up with a new and different password for each of your online accounts, then how do you remember all of them? A &lt;strong&gt;password manager&lt;/strong&gt; comes to the rescue. It will not only save all your passwords for your online accounts, but it will also automatically generate new and strong passwords for you when you register a new account. So you don’t have to wrack your brain about coming up with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice of a password manager for this is &lt;a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;. There are other good options out there, but this is what I have been personally using for years now, and I am happy with it. It will run in any popular browser you are using on your computer and also on your smartphone as an app, so you always have access to it. And you can get started with it for free. In addition to storing credentials, you can also save all kinds of Secure Notes onto LastPass, for example, credit card PINs, bank account numbers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WI&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt; passwords, or anything else valuable but private, that you would like to&amp;nbsp;remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You need to remember a few strong&amp;nbsp;passwords&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your password manager will remember the password for all your online accounts, but you need to remember the master password of your password manager itself. And this needs to be a strong password. However, strong passwords are generally hard to remember because they need to be lengthy first and&amp;nbsp;foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I recommend is that you come up with a long, full sentence that is meaningful to you so that you can remember it. And ideally, have at least one number as well in it. Then write that without any spaces. You can find a more in-depth article with some good ideas on how to create a strong password at &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/"&gt;HowToGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the password for LastPass, I would also recommend that you similarly remember a strong password for your primary email account (even though that will be in LastPass as well). Because through your email, you can restore access to any other online account that you need, but it’s more problematic if you lose access to your email account as well because you can’t get into LastPass. Access to your email will also help you to regain access to LastPass if you forget the master password. And the vice versa is true as well. So it’s a bit of a safety measure, you rely on two strong passwords, not just&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to migrate your existing&amp;nbsp;credentials&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have LastPass up and running, any new online account registrations will be saved there with a strong and unique password. But what about all your existing online&amp;nbsp;accounts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you log in to an account for the first time, LastPass will ask if you want to save those credentials. Choose yes. Then once you have collected most of your accounts in LastPass, you can go through them and change the password for each to a newly generated, strong password. Or even go ahead and change it when you need to use it for the first time from now on. There is also a Security Challenge feature which checks your existing saved passwords and warns you about any duplicates and other issues. Once you resolve all of them, you should be in an excellent&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Use two-factor&amp;nbsp;authentication&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For really important and highly used online accounts, like Google, Facebook, Twitter, online banking, there are options for setting up two-factor authentication, and they even highly recommend it, or it’s mandatory (especially for banking). In addition to your username and password, there will be another check required to log in to your account. It could be a code sent to your mobile phone as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, or it could be a code from a mobile authentication application. On each of these online accounts, there are specific instructions on how to actually set this up and I highly encourage you to avoid skipping this&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the above sorted out, you have taken a great leap towards securing your online presence. There is a lot more to online security than this, but this is a fundamental and crucial step. Do not procrastinate on it! I wish you all the best and stay safe&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category><category term="passwords"></category><category term="online"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="lastpass"></category><category term="two-factor authentication"></category></entry></feed>
